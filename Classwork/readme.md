### CMP129 Final Project
Final project for my Computer Science II class at CCM. I created a farming simulator where users can interact with a GUI to plant, harvest, buy, and sell crops.

### CMP129_chapter_13_lab
The final version of a lab I worked on throughout the semester. Each week I would learn something new, and integrate it into the program.
